# `lots`
A dead simple terminal pager.

This is my first time writing C. `lots` is just a learning project, and as
such, it isn't particularly well-programmed or featureful.

If you're looking for an actually good terminal pager, check out
[`less`][less] or `more`, which you likely have installed already.
